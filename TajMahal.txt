The Taj Mahal is an ivory-yellow marble mausoleum located on the south bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.
 It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child.
 The mausoleum, which is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, was completed in 1648.
