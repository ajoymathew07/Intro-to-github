The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum located on the south bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.
 It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child.
 The mausoleum, which is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, was completed in 1648, with the surrounding buildings and gardens finished by 1653.
The name "Taj Mahal" is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj mahall meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace" (mahall).[6][7][8] An alternative derivation of "taj" is that it was a corruption of the second syllable of "Mumtaz".[9][10] Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his 1636 book Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.
